This is an Achievement plugin for UE5 that is currently a WIP.

As of writing (17/09/2025 18:47 CEST), there are local achievements that can be saved, loaded and deleted as well as Steam integration (which by default links to Spacewars)

In order to try the plugin yourself, please download the Achievement Plugin from the Plugins folder.

The achievements can be set up in the developer settings including saving and loading.

Please keep in mind that this project is still nowhere near done and there will be an actual tutorial on how to use the service in the following weeks. For now I'd recommend just looking at whatever you are interested in and wait for a full release :D
